Making React Test Projects ヽ(⌐■_■)ノ♪♬

# Creating a React App
1. `npm install -g create-react-app`
    - Install the global package to be used to create skeleton of React app
    - This is Facebook supported
2. `create-react-app application_name_goes_here`
    - Create the app
    - This installs libraries for you if they are not already installed
        - react
        - react-dom
        - react-scripts
        - possibly some others???

# HelloWorld

- `npm run hello_world/`
    - Runs the app in the development mode


# test_app_one

- `npm run test_app_one/`
    - Runs the app in the development mode
